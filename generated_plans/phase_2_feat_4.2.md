# Phase 2, Feature 4.2: Healthz Endpoint for Container Health Checks

## Objective:
To add a `/healthz` endpoint to the Go SPA server, allowing container orchestration platforms (like Kubernetes) to perform health checks and determine the application's readiness and liveness.

## Technical Steps:

1.  [x] **Implement Healthz Handler:**
    *   [x] Create a new HTTP handler function (e.g., `HealthzHandler`) in `server/handlers.go`.
    *   [x] This handler should respond with a `200 OK` status code for successful health checks.
    *   [x] For initial implementation, a simple `w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)` is sufficient.

2.  [x] **Integrate Healthz Endpoint:**
    *   [x] Register the new `HealthzHandler` with the server's router (e.g., in `server/server.go` or `main.go`).
    *   [x] The endpoint should be accessible at `/healthz`.

3.  [x] **Add Unit Tests:**
    *   [x] Create a new test file (e.g., `server/handlers_test.go` or a new `server/healthz_test.go`).
    *   [x] Write unit tests to verify that the `/healthz` endpoint returns a `200 OK` status.
    *   [x] Ensure test coverage for the new handler.

4.  [x] **Update Documentation:**
    *   [x] Modify `DEPLOYMENT.md` to include information about the new `/healthz` endpoint.
    *   [x] Update the Kubernetes Deployment example in `DEPLOYMENT.md` to demonstrate how to configure `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` using the `/healthz` endpoint.
    *   [x] Briefly mention the purpose of health checks in the context of container orchestration.

5.  [x] **Verify Functionality (Manual/Local):**
    *   [x] Run the Go server locally.
    *   [x] Access `http://localhost:8081/healthz` (or the configured port) in a browser or using `curl` to confirm it returns a `200 OK`.

## Success Criteria:
- The `/healthz` endpoint is accessible and returns `200 OK`.
- Unit tests for the healthz handler pass.
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` is updated with health check configuration examples.
